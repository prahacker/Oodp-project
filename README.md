This implementation uses the Luhn algorithm, which is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, including credit card numbers. The algorithm works by summing up the digits of the number, and applying a special rule to every second digit (starting from the rightmost digit) to transform it into a single-digit number. If the final sum is divisible by 10, the number is valid.
